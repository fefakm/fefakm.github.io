            <p>Welcome to Friendly Paws!</p> 
            <p>Our mission is to care for the abandoned, abused, injured and special
                needs dogs which have nowhere else to turn and to provide the love and attention they never had until a
                forever home is found.</p>
            <p>Special needs pets are among the most challenging for shelters and rescue groups to adopt out, and many
                never find a loving home. Yet your perfect companion might just have their own pair of wheels to get
                around,
                or rely on visual commands instead of verbal ones.
                Three legged or one-eyes just like a cute little pirate, these pets are overflowing of limitless love.
            </p>
            <p>Get to know us and pay us a visit!</p>
            <p>You might just find your best-friend where you least expected!</p>

            <h3>What is a special needs pets?</h3>
            <p>It generally includes a range of physical disabilities, chronic medical conditions or behavioral issues
                that require ongoing vigilance or special care to manage. It can include animals with obvious physical
                distinctions, such as missing, deformed or paralyzed limbs – or those with functional limitations, such
                as animals who are blind or deaf. Although often requiring some type of dedicated
                care or training, most special needs pets are otherwise just like any other.</p>

            <h3>Your concerns are valid!</h3>
            <p>Adopting a special needs pet can definitely bring some challenges. It's normal to feel worried about
                extra medical or training costs, or have unfounded biases against a pet that they perceive is less than
                “perfect.” But here at Friendly Paws we provide all the resources necessary for you to overcome such
                impressions.</p>

            <h3>Lots of love and devotion to give!</h3>
            <p>Special needs pets are not defined by their circumstances, and are not aware of how they may be
                different. They are first and foremost a dog or cat. With the right attitude, and the right resources,
                special needs pets can easily adapt to their new homes and lifestyles better
                than you might think! Just adopt and add love in their lives!</p>
